# Ultimate Tools
Open source code & wiki for my ultimate tools mod

## Keybinds
To operate the multitools, you'll need to make use of the two keybound functions I've provided.

**Default keybinds:**
- `O` key: Toggle the right-click function of the tool between creating farmland and creating paths
- `;` key: Toggle between shearing plant blocks (leaves, grass, etc) versus just breaking it.

*You can modify keybinds in the default Minecraft keybind menu*
